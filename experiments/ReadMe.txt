This folder contains the collection of experimental results with D2C-2.0 on the systems named with respective folder names. 

- `exp_1' to `exp_5' are based on Linear Least Square with Central Difference (LLS-CD).
- `exp_6' to `exp_10' are based on Finite Differences.
- `exp_11' is used for testing the robustness of D2C-2.0's closed loop policy. So, a suitable LQR is picked for feedback instead of using the converged gains in ILQR.
